Git Repository for developing introductory learnr lessons.

So far, this includes:

* A basic ggplot lesson: `ggplot-basics`
* Two lessons on tidy data: 
    * one for identifying untidy data sets `tidy-data`, and
    * another for fixing them `make-tidy`.

For those hosting these lessons on a shiny server, please note that the files must be *locally rendered* to create the .HTML-file before they will work.
